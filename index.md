# Myros
**My** **R**ust **O**perating **S**ystem

---

Myros is a hobby operating system I am developing in Rust. Years ago, I toyed with operating system development in C and C++. Learning Rust has rekindled that interest.

While developing Myros, I'm also creating a tutorial of sorts (though I don't consider myself an expert in operating system development), explaining what I'm doing and why, so that others can learn from my experience. The various posts that make up this tutorial will be posted here.

In this tutorial, I make the assumption that you have at least some familiarity with the following:

- general programming,
- the Rust programming language in particular,
- x86 assembly, and
- the command line, especially the Linux or UNIX command line.

If your programming experience is limited, I would highly recommend gaining more experience before taking on an operating system development project. If you haven't yet had experience programming in Rust, you may be able to understand the Rust code presented here and apply it to other languages. However, if you want to develop your own OS in Rust, I would highly recommend reading [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) and playing around with the language a bit first. In particular, spend some time getting used to the borrow checker, and familiarize yourself with the concept of safe versus unsafe code.
